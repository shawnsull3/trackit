## If you can measure and track it, you can improve it ##

## Overview ##
   Company’s learn a bunch about their customers from their data, so why couldn’t we as customers use data from our everyday lives to learn about and improve ourselves. Through tracking various habits such as sleep, subjective feeling, workouts, hours of creative work, etc user's can notice trends and correlations within themselves, and armed with that knowledge they can make better decisions based on their goals.

  ### Goals
  * Allow users to track and visualize habits
  * Eventually, allow users to be able to add whatever habit / attribute to that they want to track
  * Provide easy to interpret correlation graphs (ie: hours of sleep plotted against subjective feeling)
